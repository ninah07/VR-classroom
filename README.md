# VR Classroom Template
## File structure
To aid in combining projects together later it is important that you help maintain the folder structure. For this reason you should setup a data folder for yourself and rename the scene
* Default_data
	* All of Micah's data that all classrooms have as a starting point
* STUDENTNAME_data
	* All of your data, rename the folder with your first and last name to aid in keeping track when all projects are brought together
* Scenes
	* STUDENTNAME_classroom - Rename this to have your first and last name to aid in keeping track of the scenes. Having separate each student have a separate data folder and a communal scene folder should help me in bringing them together
* SteamVR / SteamVR_Input / SteamVR_Resources / StreamingAssets / XR
	* These need to be in the main asset folder, I could not move them into Default_data

## Use
* Download the template
* Unzip the template
* Rename all instances of STUDENTNAME with your full name (i.e MicahChubb_data)
* Edit the classroom scene to your liking
* Store all the assets and other data that you need in your data folder, this will help copy all things needed to run your classroom into the one project at the end when Micah is combining everything

## What if I need to edit a VR script?
* Make a new script with a unique name / class name.
* Copy the VR script basis in
* Adjust as necessary
* Put in your data folder
